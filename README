FetchmailMon - a mail fetching processus monitor
--------------------------------------------------

Introduction

  These programs (the aim is to provide many applets) try to help
  fetchmail users having a single dialup connexion. For such users
  it's hard to decide wether or not the mail fetching process is
  done. FetchmailMon will provide numbers applets (for each desktop
  X11, WindowMaker, Gnome, KDE, ...) to monitor graphically the 
  /var/log/mail.log in order to decide if the dialup connection
   could be closed.

  Now, FetchmailMon is in its early stages: only one tool is
  available and it's not graphic. It is a simple tool that read
  /var/log/mail.log on it's input and rewrite informations in it's
  ouput (not possible to do simplier).

Platform

  This program was written on and for Linux/Intel/ELF/libc6.
  It should compile cleanly on any ANSI-C environment.
